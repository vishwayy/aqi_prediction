# AQI Prediction Analysis with Linear Regression

This GitHub repository contains the code and resources for predicting Air Quality Index (AQI) using Linear Regression. Air Quality Index is a crucial metric for assessing and communicating the quality of air in a specific location. This project leverages the simplicity and interpretability of Linear Regression to analyze and predict AQI values.

## Overview

- **Dataset:** The dataset used comprises historical air quality measurements, including pollutants such as particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide.
- **Model:** Utilizes Linear Regression, a straightforward and widely-used regression algorithm.
- **Language:** The implementation is in Python, making use of popular data science libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn.
- **Usage:** The repository provides code and documentation for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Key Features

1. **Data Exploration:** Initial exploration and visualization of the AQI dataset.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and transforming raw air quality data for effective model training.
3. **Linear Regression Model:** Implementation and training of the Linear Regression model for AQI prediction.
4. **Evaluation Metrics:** Assessment of model performance using relevant metrics.
5. **Visualization:** Visual representation of predicted AQI values compared to actual values.

## Clone the repository:
